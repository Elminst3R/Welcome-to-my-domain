Project 01: Personal Website by Emiliusz Smorczewski

User Stories:
As a user, I want the website to be accessible on desktop and mobile, so I do not have to be tethered to one device when accesing the website.
As a user, I want the website to have a comment section, so I can act on feedback received..
As a user, I want the website to have a news section, so I can stay up to date with any new events that come up.

The project is a simple sample peronal website in which the user can acess some about me information, scroll through photos, leave comments, view news, donate to see how the donation link works, follow on social media, access html, css, and js documentation for whatever reason, and acess a mega menu that at the time does nothing due to time constraints of the project.

To improve the website I would play around with the scaling ratios to create a better user experience on a tablet because things look a bit akward in that mode. Probably mobile and desktop adjustment as well.
I would also change how the mega menu is acessed. Right now it's both hover and click and the imlpementation is not that great, but I would change it only to click. Hover does not work on a mobile device. When inspecting the website on a desktop browser hover works fine, but the true test is acessing the website on a mobile device via localhost which I did while connected to wifi to my router by typing the ip adress of my desktop machine and the local server port on my mobile device.
I want to play around with picture-in-picture mode. It's not convenient to play the music video in the background and when it comes to navgating to other parts of the website the music stops playing.
Mega menu needs the links added to HTML and CSS.

I did not write 100% of the code from scratch as I did use code from W3schools.com, stackoverflow, and code from google searches. I do understand a lot of the concepts and what most of the code does, but the only section I don't understand is the embedding of the youtube video on my page that is responsive with the page. It works though. I need to learn.

Anyway, the way I gained underanding of most of the code is use documentation, as well as use /*border: 5px solid red;*/ extensively to see how each element is affected in CSS and figure out what the code does under each element. That was honestly the best way to learn. Coding in CSS is so very particular as every item needs instruction, but that applies to general coding.

What I was proud of was the use of gridbox and flexbox on the same page of the photos page. "classes" and "ids" are SUPER helpful in that execution as for a second I was worried how I would implement that on the same page. It felt like an eureka moment. Well the whole project felt that way. Five days ago I had no idea how to create a website, now I can't wait to try recreate a website like Facebook or YouTube. We'll see.
